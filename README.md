Contributors: Spencer Auslander, Paul Boerstoel, Femi Ademuwagun, Samantha Barbey, Anthony Trainor, & Sophie Barstein



**Description**
This project analyzes the global homicide trends throughout the past several decades, and demonstrates the relationship between homicide rate, freedom index, gender, GDP, and literary rates across countries. 



**File Descriptions**
*Images Folder*: Contains graph images from the Homicides vs Freedom Score Jupyter file. Images were used for the google slides
*Homicides Are Falling Around the World - Homicides Are Falling Around the World.csv*: Excel file containing data relate to homicide rates. Dataset was read and manipulated in the Homicides vs Freedom Score Jupyter file. Dataset source: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/VC.IHR.PSRC.P5
*Homicides vs Freedom Score.ipynb*: Jupyter file for analysis between Homicides and Freedom score. Manipulation of dataset into dataframe and into graphs. Code is commented for readability. Data used in google slides.
*freedom-scores.csv*: Excel file containing data relate to freedom scores. Dataset was read and manipulated in the Homicides vs Freedom Score Jupyter file. Dataset source: https://www.heritage.org/index/explore

LiteracyRateAnalysis: Contains the notebook and csv files relevant for the literacy rate vs homicide rate analysis section of the project. Literacy_rates_vs_homicide_rates.ipynb is the main notebook for that part of the analysis.
Homicides Are Falling Around the World.csv: Same as the other file of the same name
API_SE.ADT.LITR.ZS_DS2_en_csv_v2_5728795.csv: csv of literacy rates by country and year, taken from the world bank: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.ADT.LITR.ZS 
Images: like with the previous folder of the same name, a folder with images used in the presentation. Images taken from the literacy rate analysis notebook.

Homicide By Gender Analysis: Contains the notebook for the gender analysis portion of the project and png files displaying the graphs created. Data collected from: https://genderdata.worldbank.org/indicators/vc-ihr-psrc-p5/?gender=female&geos=&view=trend

*Project 1 - Homicide Data Doc.pdf*: Word document with the written analysis of the data. 
*Project 1 - Homicide Data Slide.pdf*: Powerpoint document that presents our data.

Conclusion:
All over the world, countries face the same issues with homicides, but for ddifferent reasons. Shockingly, countries homicide rates are effected due to income. The upper middle income has the highest GDP in the last 20 years. Throughout the years of 1990-2020, there is a drastic difference between males and females. Although the numbers are substantially larger from males to females, the trend lines tend to follow the same pattern. This leads us to the question, "why?" Although we are not sure why these numbers seem to be steady with eachother, we can conclude that the data shown can provide us with the information needed to create change. These factors include but are not limited to the country in which one resides, income (lower to upper class/income), the years the crime was being committed, literacy (how well one is living), and the sex that is commiting these homicides.
